    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "Is this service completely free?",
    "a1": "New users receive 100 credits upon registration. Recipe generation is free, but image generation consumes 1 credit per image. We will soon launch service packages and reward systems to provide more ways to earn credits.",
    "q2": "Can I add ingredients that aren't listed?",
    "a2": "Yes! Simply type any ingredient into the search box and press Enter. Custom ingredients show up with a white background and yellow text, so you can easily spot them. Our AI will create recipes with whatever ingredients you add!",
    "q3": "How are recipe images generated?",
    "a3": "We first use AI to generate recipes based on the ingredients you select and input. Once the recipe is created, we use AI again to generate corresponding images based on the recipe name.",
    "q4": "How long does the transformation process take?",
    "a4": "Most recipes are generated in 20-60 seconds. The exact time depends on the number of ingredients selected, recipe count, AI model chosen, and current server load. More ingredients or multiple recipes may require additional processing time. During peak hours, you may experience slightly longer wait times due to high demand.",
    "q5": "How can I provide feedback or report issues?",
    "a5": "We'd love to hear from you! Please share your feedback or report any problems by contacting our support team at annnb016@gmail.com. Your input helps us continuously improve our service.",
    "q6": "Can I use the generated images commercially?",
    "a6": "Yes. The generated images are free for both personal and commercial use, but please ensure not to infringe on other brands' copyright."
