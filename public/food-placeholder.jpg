This file should be replaced with a actual food-placeholder.jpg image.

Recommended characteristics for the placeholder image:
1. Simple, neutral food-related design
2. Approximately 800x600 pixels
3. Not too large in file size (ideally under 100KB)
4. Clearly visible in both light and dark modes
5. Professional looking (not a "broken image" icon)

You can use a generic food photo, a simple plate icon, or a custom "image not available" design with food elements.
